I am a PhD candidate in Human-Computer Interaction at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/afdelingen/sustainable-design-engineering/kind">Knowledge and Intelligence Design group </a> (KInD) at the [Department of Sustainable Design Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/about-ide/departments/sustainable-design-engineering/) within the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, TU Delft. 

My research is focused on exploring how AI can provide human-centered knowledge management for workers. My contributions include empirical lab studies, studies in the wild, tools and system design. My PhD supervisors are [Alessandro Bozzon](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/about-ide/people/bozzon-a) (promotor) and [Evangelos Niforatos](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/about-ide/people/niforatos-e/) (daily supervisor).
