I am a PhD researcher in Human-Computer Interaction at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/afdelingen/sustainable-design-engineering/kind">Knowledge and Intelligence Design group </a> KInD at the [Department of Sustainable Design Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/about-ide/departments/sustainable-design-engineering/) with the faculty of Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, TU Delft. 

My research is focused on exploring how AI can provide human-centered knowledge management for workers. My contributions range from empirical studies, studies in the wild, tools and system design. My PhD supervisors are Alessandron Bozzon (promotor) and Evangelos Niforatos (daily supervisor).
