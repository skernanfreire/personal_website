# Supervision
2021-present: **Masters Thesis Supervisor** - TU Delft - Responsible for the weekly supervision of Industrial Design Engineering MSc students during their graduation.

- 2023: [**Exploring the possibilities of ChatGPT for ICU digital diary in the context of ICU**](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Abee3af71-23e0-4bd9-bae0-de4de042a1c6?collection=education) - Kaixin Tang - 
ICU survivors have been shown to face memory loss during and after their ICU stays, which contributes the psychological issues. ICU digital diary has been proven as a way of filling the memory gap, thus avoiding the development of these mental issues. EMC has currently been working on the implementation of the digital diary and a tailored...

- 2023: [**Tailored family adaptation to living in a zero-energy house: Occupant’s crises and conflicts with a heat pump-based system**](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A110817bb-e926-4e77-8675-63d2bdeafb3a?collection=education) - Yichen Jin - 
This project belongs to the IEBB project, which advocates for the renovation of ‘zero energy houses’ (ZEH) that synergize insulation and heat pump systems for energy conservation. The ZEH’s energy-saving efficiency depends on user behaviour. From a systems perspective, improper human interactions hinder energy saving, while...

- 2023: [**Teleoperation With Force Feedback: A Case Study On Anti-Sway For Offshore Applications**](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Ac4fe9a06-ac53-4a67-95ab-552fa6605070?collection=education) - Niyaz Veitschegger - 
This master’s thesis is an exploration of force feedback in offshore applications with the intention of teleoperating heavy machinery. Specifically, Allseas provided their field joint coating machine handling for offshore pipelay as the subject and scope of this study. The anti-sway use case is identified through literature research, user and...

- 2022: [**Root cause analysis by operators with the aid of a cognitive advisor in manufacturing**](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Ac974ef60-9af3-4215-b2f9-c9afc1e5833c?collection=education) - Jeroen Schunselaar -
This thesis project examines the opportunities for manufacturing operators to use root cause analysis directly at the line with the support of a cognitive advisor. The project was part of the EU Horizon COALA project and uses a specific business case at a detergent company as a base for the research and the prototype development. The analysis of...

- 2021: [**Ethical task tracking of operators in agile manufacturing**](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A3408e8c3-809b-436d-94eb-efb4f0532b17?collection=education) - Sarath Surendranadha Panicker - 
Diversey BV, a major player of professional hygiene product manufacturing, is facing challenges with agile manufacturing of hygienic products with changeover process consuming most of production time. They are collaborating with the EU-Horizon 2020 COALA project to develop a cognitive intelligent assistant for the production line. They expect to...

- 2021: [**Design of a conversational assistant for standardized issue description in manufacturing**](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Ad71944a2-55a7-4381-97b0-c4f821824704?collection=education) - Boris Hadžisejdić - 
This thesis describes the design and development of a conversational assistant (CA) for standardized issue descriptions in manufacturing. The CA was specifically targeted at the acquisition of data on standardized issue descriptions and at the same time reduce operator friction with the system. CAs can be used to handle and process repetitive...
