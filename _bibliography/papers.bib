title = "A Cognitive Assistant for Operators: AI-Powered Knowledge Sharing on Complex Systems",
abstract = "Operating a complex and dynamic system, such as an agile manufacturing line, is a knowledge-intensive task. It imposes a steep learning curve on novice operators and prompts experienced operators to continuously discover new knowledge, share it, and retain it. In practice, training novices is resource-intensive, and the knowledge discovered by experts is not shared effectively. To tackle these challenges, we developed an AI-powered pervasive system that provides cognitive augmentation to users of complex systems. We present an AI cognitive assistant that provides on-the-job training to novices while acquiring and sharing (tacit) knowledge from experts. Cognitive support is provided as dialectic recommendations for standard work instructions, decision-making, training material, and knowledge acquisition. These recommendations are adjusted to the user and context to minimize interruption and maximize relevance. In this article, we describe how we implemented the cognitive assistant, how it interacts with users, its usage scenarios, and the challenges and opportunities.",

title = "Harnessing Large Language Models for Cognitive Assistants in Factories",
abstract = "As agile manufacturing expands and workforce mobility increases, the importance of efficient knowledge transfer among factory workers grows. Cognitive Assistants (CAs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5, can bridge knowledge gaps and improve worker performance in manufacturing settings. This study investigates the opportunities, risks, and user acceptance of LLM-powered CAs in two factory contexts: textile and detergent production. Several opportunities and risks are identified through a literature review, proof-of-concept implementation, and focus group sessions. Factory representatives raise concerns regarding data security, privacy, and the reliability of LLMs in high-stake environments. By following design guidelines regarding persistent memory, real-time data integration, security, privacy, and ethical concerns, LLM-powered CAs can become valuable assets in manufacturing settings and other industries.

abstract = "Learning to operate a complex system, such as an agile production line, can be a daunting task. The high variability in products and frequent reconfigurations make it difficult to keep documentation up-to-date and share new knowledge amongst factory workers. We introduce CLAICA, a Continuously Learning AI Cognitive Assistant that supports workers in the aforementioned scenario. CLAICA learns from (experienced) workers, formalizes new knowledge, stores it in a knowledge base, along with contextual information, and shares it when relevant. We conducted a user study with 83 participants who performed eight knowledge exchange tasks with CLAICA, completed a survey, and provided qualitative feedback. Our results provide a deeper understanding of how prior training, context expertise, and interaction modality affect the user experience of cognitive assistants. We draw on our results to elicit design and evaluation guidelines for cognitive assistants that support knowledge exchange in fast-paced and demanding environments, such as an agile production line.

The operation of complex systems such as a manufacturing line is knowledge-intensive, especially if the operator must frequently reconfigure it for different products. Considering the breadth and dynamic nature of this knowledge, existing solutions for sharing knowledge (e.g., word-of-mouth, issue reports, document creation, and decision support systems) are inefficient and/or resource-intensive. Conversational user interfaces are an efficient way to convey information that mimics the way humans share knowledge; however, we know little about how to design them specifically for this purpose, especially regarding tacit knowledge. In this work, my main goal is to investigate how a cognitive assistant can be designed to facilitate (tacit) knowledge transfer between users of dynamic complex systems. I aim to achieve this by outlining the design requirements, challenges, and opportunities in factories; by collaboratively designing, implementing, and evaluating a cognitive assistant for sharing knowledge; studying the effects of design characteristics on aspects such as user experience; and finally, creating a set of design guidelines.",

title = "A Conversational User Interface for Instructional Maintenance Reports",
abstract = "Maintaining a complex system, such as a modern production line, is a knowledge-intensive task. Many firms use maintenance reports as a decision support tool. However, reports are often poor quality and tedious to compile. A Conversational User Interface (CUI) could streamline the reporting process by validating the user's input, eliciting more valuable information, and reducing the time needed. In this paper, we use a Technology Probe to explore the potential of a CUI to create instructional maintenance reports. We conducted a between-groups study (N = 24) in which participants had to replace the inner tube of a bicycle tire. One group documented the procedure using a CUI while replacing the inner tube, whereas the other group compiled a paper report afterward. The CUI was enacted by a researcher according to a set of rules. Our results indicate that using a CUI for maintenance reports saves a significant amount of time, is no more cognitively demanding than writing a report, and results in maintenance reports of higher quality.

title = "Break, Repair, Learn, Break Less: Investigating User Preferences for Assignment of Divergent Phrasing Learning Burden in Human-Agent Interaction to Minimize Conversational Breakdowns",
abstract = "Conversational agents (CA) occasionally fail to understand the user's intention or respond inappropriately due to natural language complexity. These conversational breakdowns can happen because of low intent and entity prediction confidence scores. A promising repair strategy in such cases is that the CA proposes to users likely alternatives to proceed. If one of these options matches the user's intention, the breakdown is repaired successfully. We propose that successful repairs should be followed by a learning mechanism to minimize future breakdowns. After a successful repair, the CA, user, or both can learn each other's specific phrasing. This prevents similar phrasings from causing reoccurring breakdowns. We compared user preferences for these learning mechanisms in a scenario-based study with manufacturing workers (). Our result showed that users first prefer to share the learning burden with the CA (61.3%), followed by entirely outsourcing the learning burden to the CA (60.7%) as opposed to themselves.",

title = "A Conversational AI Agent for Industrial Maintenance Reporting",
abstract = "This project is an exploration of potential applications of Conversational AI Agents (CAIA) for industrial maintenance. Specifically, it involves the scientific validation and development of a CAIA for a promising application: the automatic creation of information-rich maintenance reports by conversing with a technician while they perform industrial maintenance. The choice for this application was based on literature research, (in-situ) context analyses and a review of CAIA frameworks and design guidelines. These revealed that maintenance workers rely heavily on their own experience and intuition when solving problems but mechanisms for capturing and accessing this were non-existent. This knowledge is highly valuable and can represent a significant part of a company’s worth. Furthermore, maintenance technicians reported that the existing reporting mechanisms were a nuisance. Lastly, audits revealed that maintenance reports were frequently incomplete or of poor quality. In turn, CAIAs (Conversational AI Agents), have various affordances that make them well-suited to the context of industrial maintenance. They are (1) hands and gaze-free, (2) highly efficient (faster than writing or typing, facilitate multitasking and they provide faster access to specific information), (3) they can adapt to the skill level of the user and (4) impose a minimal cognitive load.
A between-subjects experiment with 24 participants, which involved changing a bicycle inner tube, was used to test three hypotheses regarding the potential value of the application. All three hypotheses compare using a CAIA for reporting whilst performing maintenance, as opposed to writing the reports on paper afterwards. They posited that using the CAIA would result in (1) reports of higher quality (more information relevant to the understanding of the task), (2) time saving, and (3) a lower perceived workload (NASA TLX). T-tests confirmed that all three hypotheses were true. These results indicate that using a CAIA for live-reporting has a clear value proposition for the industrial maintenance domain. Critically, it demonstrated that it could facilitate the capture of valuable “expert knowledge”. Future research could explore integrating multi-modal information capture (e.g. through smart-glasses), identify additional uses for the captured data (e.g. for prescriptive maintenance or providing tips to maintenance technicians) and improve the functionality and usability of the existing application. A prototype was built using the open-source frameworks, Rasa and Mycroft, to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the functional requirements. These requirements include (1) uttering “continuers” in response to the user describing their work, (2) tracking conversational context, (3) asking for clarifications when there is a lack of mutual understanding and (4) asking for status updates when the user is silent for more than a set amount of time. The main challenges for the future development of the prototype are (1) reducing the response time of the CAIA, (2) the accuracy of the intent classifier and entity extractor and (3) improving the handling of fragmented/lengthy user input. Some of the prototype’s features rely on inflexible, hard-coded logic, therefore, future work should collect more conversational data and explore the use of machine learning algorithms.",
